		<h1> Indigenous Edible Plants Found in South Africa </h1>
		<p> South Africa is home to more than 22 000 indigenous seed plants from almost 230 different families. Indigenous vegetable crops that can be utilized for food preparation include those with tender leaves, stems, and stalks. Indigenous trees and fynbos attract pollinators and birds that will spread pollen and seeds and in turn create a self-sustaining ecosystem. </p>
